Although I am originally from New York, I currently live in Chicago, IL, having moved here to attend school at Northwestern University. My interests are varied: I enjoy the outdoors, weightlifting, and lounging with my two cats when given the chance.</p>
  <div class="row text-left"><p>I would describe myself as a jack of all trades. I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Florida, earning a B.S. in Exercise Physiology. I then continued my formal eduaction, earning a M.S. in Neurobiology. My interests now lie in learning how to code, and applying that to the neuroscience knowledge that I have, in order to broach the field of neural interfacing.</p>
